To properly run the test_mnist, create a data/ directory in the project folder
and place the uncompressed t10k and train image data files in it. Otherwise the tests will fail.
Discussion of design choices
============================

KNN
=========
To assist in the K-nearest neighbors calculations, I created a data structure 
called knn_data, which contains:
  - the mnist_image_handle of the test image
  - the mnist_dataset_handle of the training dataset
  - the calculated distances between the test image and each training image
  - the labels of the training images
  - the minimum distances between the test image and of the closest image for each label

I only calculate the distances once for each combination of test image and 
training set, using knn_get_distances.  This procedure populates the 
distances, labels and minimum distances in a knn_data struct.  I calculate 
the minimum distances in order to break ties in the case that there are 
multiple labels with the same number of closest neighbors.  If an image is 
the exact same distance from all the k-nearest neighbor labels that have 
plurality, the algorithm returns the FIRST of those label that occurs in 
the dataset.

QUICKSELECT
============
I implemented the K-nearest neighbors algorithm by using the Quickselect 
algorithm; I got the idea from the references I listed above. The Quickselect 
algorithm is able to get the k-th smallest element from an unsorted list in 
O(N) on average, and O(N^2) in worst case.  In order to implement the 
Quickselect algorithm, I also had to make an ancillary algorithm called 
Partition, which given a pivot value, will move everything less than 
pivot_value to the left of the list and everything greater to the right. 
My implementation of Quickselect is 0-indexed, meaning if you want the 
smallest value you would set k=0, and for the second smallest value you would 
set k=1, etc.

Since the Quickselect algorithm sorts the list of distances, I had to modify 
it to sort the list of labels at the same time so I could easily find the 
labels of all the images with smaller than k-th smallest distance (i.e. the 
first k labels in the sorted labels list).

Testing the k-nearest neighbor algorithm was challenging - I created a 
number of test datasets whose sum of pixel values had a relationship with the 
label value.  This way I could easily create and test a number of scenarios.

RESERVOIR SAMPLING
==================
In order to implement mnist_create_sample, I used the an algorithm I used in 
a previous homework called the Fisher-Yates shuffle, which randomizes an
array in O(N) time. I had used in a previous homework.  I also created a
small algorithm that returns a TRUE uniform pseudo-random number over a 
range, as opposed to simply using rand()%range (which can have bias). I did 
consult stackoverflow.com for the _uniform_rand_int algorithm, but I cannot 
find the exact link that I used.

DISTANCE FUNCTIONS
==================
I only implemented two distance functions (euclid and reduced). I maintain a 
number of macros in distance.h that can be used to determine the number of 
functions that are implemented, which functions are implemented, and their 
descriptions.  Any time a new distance function is added, these macros need 
to be updated, along with the factory function.
